Complete VPC
Configuration in this directory creates set of VPC resources which may be sufficient for staging or production environment (look into simple-vpc for more simplified setup).

There are public, private, database, ElastiCache, intra (private w/o Internet access) subnets, and NAT Gateways created in each availability zone.

Usage
To run this example you need to execute:

$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run terraform destroy when you don't need these resources.
